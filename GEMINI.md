# rldyour Gemini CLI Context

You are operating inside the `rldyour-gemini` adapter repository. This adapter
configures Gemini CLI with native Gemini surfaces for the rldyour AI CLI control
plane.

## Current Facts

- Adapter version: `1.0.3`.
- Runtime baseline: `@google/gemini-cli` `0.46.0`.
- Supported access target: enterprise, paid API-key, Vertex AI, Google Cloud, or
  explicitly owner-approved authenticated environments.
- Consumer OAuth availability after June 18, 2026 is not promised because Google
  is transitioning unpaid and Google One users to Antigravity CLI.
- Antigravity CLI is out of scope for this adapter release.

## Operating Rules

- Use Gemini-native configuration files: `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/settings.json`,
  `gemini-extension.json`, TOML commands, skills, agents, hooks, and policies.
- Do not introduce Playwright MCP or Semgrep active configuration.
- Keep browser routing split: Webwright for long-horizon workflows, Playwright
  CLI for screenshots/flows/visual evidence, Chrome DevTools MCP for debugging.
- Gemini built-in `browser_agent` is disabled for this release; do not enable it
  unless it is modeled as a separate explicit provider with validators.
- In standard mode, the owner/user remains the orchestration layer.
- In cmux mode, orchestration exists only as visible terminal sessions.
- Gemini subagents are internal Gemini CLI delegation, not cmux workers.
- Headless `gemini -p` is allowed for smoke, doctor, and CI checks only.
- Never commit secrets, OAuth state, service-account files, browser artifacts,
  runtime caches, or temporary evidence.

## Required Report Shape

When reporting work, include exact files changed, commands run, pass/fail
results, and any `NOT PROVEN` gaps. Do not claim release certification unless
the root control plane and all adapter gates pass.
